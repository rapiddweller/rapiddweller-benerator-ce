If problems remain unsolved after reading this book, do not hesitate to contact us for help. rapiddweller-benerator-ce is and remains open-source and
is provided for free.

If you are interested in additional support, and our premium features, we encourage you to check the
website **[www.benerator.de](https://www.benerator.de/)**. We offer additional services to make your data generation project a success and provide
detailed use cases to ease your start into more complex scenarios.

Since you can do quite a lot of different things with Benerator but surely are interested in just a part of it, here's some guidance:

**'[Goals and Features](introduction_to_benerator.md)'**, introduces you to the goals and features of Benerator. 

Find advise on how to install a binary distribution and how to get
the sources and set up an IntelliJ/Eclipse project for using, debugging, and customizing Benerator in **'[Installation](installation.md)'**.

**'[Data Generation Concepts](data_generation_concepts.md)'**, **'[Descriptor File Format](quick_tour_through_the_descriptor_file_format.md)'** and **'[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)'** then provide you with a structured and complete introduction
into the Benerator descriptor file setup.

Benerator supports a multitude of service provider interfaces (SPIs). It comes along with some implementations for specific business domains (**'
[Domains](domains.md)'**) and general-purpose classes in **'[Component Reference](component_reference.md)'**.

Finally, you are instructed how to write custom SPI implementations in **'[Extending Benerator](extending_benerator.md)'**.
