# Domains

Benerator domains are a vehicle for defining, bundling and reusing domain specific data generation, e.g. for personal data, addresses, internet,
banking, telecom. They may be localized to specific languages and be grouped to hierarchical datasets, e.g. for continents, countries and regions.

Benerator comes packaged with several domains that have simple implementation of specific data generation and may serve as a base for deriving own
specific data generation domains:

* **person**: Data related to a person

* **address**: Data related to contacting a person by post

* **net**: Internet and network related data

* **finance**: finance data

* **organization**: Organization data

* **product**: Product-related data

## person domain

The person domain has three major components:

* PersonGenerator: Generates Person beans

* AcademicTitleGenerator: Generates academic titles

* NobilityTitleGenerator: Generates nobility titles

* GivenNameGenerator: Generates given names

* FamilyNameGenerator: Generates family names

* BirthDateGenerator: Generates birth dates

* GenderGenerator: Generates Gender values. 
  The generated gender can be one of the values `MALE`, `FEMALE` and `DIVERSE`.
  The generator is configured with the properties `femaleQuota`and `diverseQuota`.

* EmailAddressGenerator: Generates Email addresses

* GenderConverter: Converts Gender values to predefined strings

* TIN: Marks a Java attribute or property as a European Tax Identification Number

* TINGenerator: Creates European Tax Identification Numbers

* TINValidator: Validates European Tax Identification Numbers

### PersonGenerator

Creates Person beans to be used for prototype-based data generation. It can be configured with dataset and locale property. The generated Person
JavaBeans exhibits the properties _salutation_, _title_ (both locale-dependent), _givenName_, _familyName_ (both dataset-dependent), _gender_, _birthDate_, _age_. If
the chosen dataset definition provides name weights, benerator generates person names according to their statistical probability. Of course, gender,
salutation and givenName are consistent.

You can use the PersonGenerator like this:

```xml
<import domains="person"/>

<generate type="user" count="5" consumer="ConsoleExporter">
    <variable name="person" generator="PersonGenerator" dataset="FR" locale="fr" />
    <attribute name="salutation" source="person.salutation" />
    <attribute name="name" script="{person.givenName +' '+ person.familyName}}" />
</generate>
```

to get output similar to this:

```
user[salutation=Mr, name=David Morel]
user[salutation=Mr, name=Robert Robert]
user[salutation=Mr, name=Eric Morel]
user[salutation=Mr, name=Patrick Lefebvre]
user[salutation=Mme, name=Helene Fournier]
```

### PersonGenerator Properties

The PersonGenerator can be configured with several properties:

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |

| locale | Two-letter-ISO-code of the language in which to create salutation and titles, e.g. en for English | The user's default language | 
| minAgeYears | The minimum age of generated persons | 15 | 
| maxAgeYears | The maximum age of generated persons | 105 | 
| femaleQuota | The quota of generated women (1 → 100%) | 0.5 |
| nobleQuota | The quota of generated noble persons (1 → 100%) | 0.005 |

Your use-cases are more sophisticated and require additional countries, cities or valid addresses down to 
street level and number, check our [Benerator Editions](https://www.benerator.de/) or feel 
free to contact us for assistance: **[team@rapiddweller.com](mailto:team@rapiddweller.com)**.

## Address domain

* **AddressGenerator**: Generates addresses that match simple validity checks: 
  The City exists, the ZIP code matches and the phone number area codes
  are right. The street names are random, so most addresses will not stand validation of real existence.

* **PhoneNumberGenerator**: Generates landline telephone numbers for a country

* **MobilePhoneNumberGenerator**: Generates mobile phone numbers for a country

* **CountryGenerator**: Generates countries

* **CountryCode2**: Annotation that marks a Java attribute or property as ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 code

* **CountryCode2Validator**: Java Bean Validation ConstraintValidator for ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 codes

* **CityGenerator**: Generates Cities for a given country

* **StreetNameGenerator**: Generates street names for a given country

* **PostalCodeValidator**: Validates if a given postal code is valid in a given country

![](assets/domain_address.png)

The following countries are supported:

| country        | code | remarks |
| ---            | ---  | --- |
| USA            |  US  | Valid ZIP codes and area codes, no assurance that the street exists in this city. |
| United Kingdom |  GB  | Valid area codes, no postcodes, no assurance that the street exists in this city or the local phone number has the appropriate length. Contributions are welcome |
| Germany        |  DE  | Valid ZIP codes and area codes, no assurance that the street exists in this city or the local phone number has the appropriate length |
| Switzerland    |  CH  | Valid ZIP codes and area codes, no assurance that the street exists in this city or the local phone number has the appropriate length |
| Brazil         |  BR  | Valid ZIP codes and area codes, no assurance that the street exists in this city or the local phone number has the appropriate length |

The generated Address objects have the following data fields:

* **street**: The regular street address

* **street2**: Additions to the street address, like c/o or postbox

* **postalCode**: the postal code

* **city**: A reference to a City object, which can be navigated and queried by a script expression, for example `{address.city.name}`

* **state**: A reference to a State object, which can be navigated and queried by a script expression, for example `{address.state.name}`

* **country**: A reference to a Country object, which can be navigated and queried by a script expression, for example `{address.country.name}`

* **privatePhone**, **officePhone**, **mobilePhone** and **fax**: References to PhoneNumber objects, which can be navigated and queried by a script expression

* **organization** and **department**: Names of an organization and a department.


## net domain

The net domain provides the

* **DomainGenerator**, which generates Internet domain names

## organization domain

Provides the following generators:

* **CompanyNameGenerator**, a generator for company names.

* **DepartmentNameGenerator**, a generator for department names

![](assets/domain_organization.png)

If you use the CompanyNameGenerator like this:

```xml
<import domains="organization" />

<generate type="company" count="5" consumer="ConsoleExporter">
    <attribute name="name" generator="CompanyNameGenerator" dataset="DE" locale="de_DE"/>
</generate>
```

you get output like this:

```
company[name=Belanda Aktiengesellschaft &amp; Co. KG]
company[name=MyWare Technologies GmbH]
company[name=WebBox AG]
company[name=Altis AG]
company[name=Ernst Fischer Technik GmbH]
```

Company names can be generated for the following countries:

| country | code | remarks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Germany | DE | none |
| USA | US | none |

The Generator creates objects of type CompanyName, consisting of **shortName**, **sector**, **location** and **
legalForm** information. You can make use of the object as a whole which is converted to a string automatically using the '**fullName**' version as
shown in the example above. But you can also make direct use of the basic properties:

```xml
<import domains="organization" />

<generate type="company" count="5" consumer="ConsoleExporter">
    <variable name="c" generator="CompanyNameGenerator" dataset="DE" locale="de_DE"/>
    <attribute name="name" script="c.shortName + ' ' + c.legalForm" />
</generate>
```
