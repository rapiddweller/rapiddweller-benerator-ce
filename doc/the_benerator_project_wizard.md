# The Benerator Project Wizard

The Benerator Project Wizard helps you to easily and quickly set up any kind of Benerator project:

* Descriptor file-driven data generation

* XML Schema-driven XML file generation

* Creation of database snapshots

## Starting the wizard

Start the Project Wizard on the command line by typing

[on Windows:]

```shell
benerator-wizard
```

[or Mac/Unix/Linux/Solaris:]

```shell
benerator-wizard
```

Depending on your language settings, the GUI welcomes you with an English or German dialog (contributions of translations are welcome). You can
override the default language settings by using Java's `user.language` system property, e.g.

```shell
benerator-wizard -Duser.language=en
```

The dialog looks like this:

## Configuring the project

Enter the project name and choose an appropriate directory.

Then you can choose among a list of predefined project types:

* **Hello World example**: Prints 'Hello World'-style output to the console

* **Simple Project**: Simple project definition for custom generation projects

* **Generate CSV file**: Defines generation of a simple CSV file

* **Populate database**: Small project that defines a database, creates a table, and populates it

* **Shop example database**: Performs Definition and population of the Benerator shop database example for all database systems supported by Benerator:
  DB2, Derby, Firebird, HSQL, H2, Oracle, PostgreSQL and SQLServer.

You can optionally make the wizard create an Eclipse project configuration, too. This requires you to have Maven installed.

If necessary, specify the database connection settings and test if they are right by clicking `Test Connection`.

When reproducing an existing database or creating a database snapshot, choose a snapshot file format: `DBUnit file`, `
Excel(TM) document`, or `SQL file`. In all other cases, choose `None`.

Finally, you can explicitly choose system-dependent settings. If you leave these fields empty, Benerator will always take the individual settings of
the system it is executed on.

## Creating and running the project

Finally, press `Create` for creating the project. The wizard then configures the project in the specified project folder.

Look into the project folder and read the readme.txt file. This contains individual instructions for your project: What further configuration steps
are eventually necessary (e.g. proprietary database drivers), how to invoke Benerator for this special project type, and how to go on with
customizations.

The easiest way to run the generated project is to run the Maven Benerator Plugin as described in the generated `readme.txt` files. The project wizard
creates all necessary files for you to execute the created projects immediately (except for proprietary database drivers: Oracle or DB2). 
However, you can also invoke Benerator directly from the command line, but you have to take care
of compiling custom Java classes in the project for yourself.
