# Component Reference

Benerator has lots of predefined generators which are available implicitly from the descriptor. Most of them only need
to be created explicitly when using the Benerator API programmatically.

## Generators

### Domain Generators

For domain-specific generators (e.g. person, address, finance), see **[Domains](domains.md)**.

### Generators For Common Id Types

Benerator contains the following common predefined and platform-independent generators:

* **IncrementalIdGenerator**: Creates consecutive id values, starting with 1 by default.

* **UUIDGenerator**: Creates UUIDs by the JDK class java.util.UUID

* **HibUUIDGenerator**: Creates UUIDs like the Hibernate UUID key generator

* **LocalSequenceGenerator**: Mimics the behavior of a (named) database sequence on a single client VM. Its property '
  cached' (true by default) specifies if sequence value changes shall be persisted immediately or in the end.

### Database-Related Generators

See **[Using Relational Databases](using_relational_databases.md)**.

### Generators For Data Of Simple Type

* **CharacterGenerator**: Generates random characters.

* **IncrementGenerator**: Generates numbers starting with one and incrementing the number on each subsequent call

* **StringGenerator**: Generates strings based on character set, prefix, suffix and length characteristics. This is the
  typical component for generating code numbers. Properties: charSet (regular expression for a character class), locale,
  unique, ordered, prefix, minInitial, suffix, minLength, maxLength, lengthGranularity, lengthDistribution

* **RegexStringGenerator**: Generates strings that match a given regular expression. This is the typical component for
  generating strings that are composed of different sub patterns. Properties: pattern (regular expression), unique,
  ordered, locale, minLength, maxLength

* **MessageGenerator**: Composes strings using a MessageFormat

* **LuhnGenerator**: Generates Luhn-valid strings like credit card numbers

### Generators For The Current Date And/Or Time

#### CurrentDateGenerator
Generates **date** values that represent the current date

#### CurrentDateTimeGenerator
Generates **date** values that represent the current date and time

#### CurrentZonedDateTimeGenerator
Generates **zoneddatetime** values that represent the current date and time. 
By default, it uses the system's default time zone. 
In order to specify a different time zone set the generator's property 
**timeZone** as described below in the **[ZonedDateTimeGenerator](component_reference.md)**.

#### CurrentMilliTimeGenerator
Generates ***long*** values that denote the number of milliseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00

#### CurrentNanoTimeGenerator
Generates **long** values that denote a number of milliseconds since an arbitrary point in
time (possible even in the future, so values may be negative)

#### CurrentTimeGenerator
Generates **date** values that represent the current time of the day


### Generators For Random Date And/Or Time Values

#### DateGenerator
Generates **date** values that represent a certain time at a certain day based on a common Distribution

#### DayGenerator
Generates **date** values that represent „day“ dates – dates at midnight

#### DateTimeGenerator
Generates **date** values with date and time configurable independentlyIts properties are: minDate,
maxDate, dateGranularity, dateDistribution, minTime, maxTime, timeGranularity, timeDistribution.

**minDate** and **maxDate** are configured in the form yyyy-MM-dd (year-month-day).

**dateGranularity** is **specified** in the form y-M-d (years-months-days), eg. 0-0-7 for weekly events, 
or 0-1-0 for monthly ones.  

**minTime** and **maxTime** need to be specified as HH:mm:ss (hours:minutes:seconds) with the hours in 24-hour-format. 

**timeGranularity** is specified in the form H:m:s (hours:minutes:seconds), eg. 0-1-0 or 0-0-60 for hourly events.

The generator is configured most easily as a JavaBean, eg. by ```<bean id="dtGen">``` and used eg. in attribute generation with ```generator="idGen""```.

As an example, for a 9-to-5 datetime on odd days of August 2010, use
```xml
<bean id="dtGen" class="DateTimeGenerator">
    <property name='minDate' value='2010-08-01'/>
    <property name='maxDate' value='2010-08-31'/>
    <property name='dateGranularity' value='00-00-02'/>
    <property name='dateDistribution' value='random'/>
    <property name='minTime' value='08:00:00'/>
    <property name='maxTime' value='17:00:00'/>
    <property name='timeGranularity' value='00:00:01'/>
    <property name='timeDistribution' value='random'/>
</bean>
```


#### ZonedDateTimeGenerator

Generates **zoneddatetime** values with a fixed timezone and 
variable date and time configurable independently. 

For the following properties, please see the description of the 
**[DateTimeGenerator](component_reference.md)** above: minDate,
maxDate, dateGranularity, dateDistribution, minTime, maxTime, 
timeGranularity, timeDistribution

By default, the generator uses the system's default time zone. 
In order to specify a different time zone set the generator's
property **timeZone** to a zone id that is supported in Java,
for example one of these:

Name                 | Zone offset
---------------------| -----------
America/Vancouver    | GMT-8
America/Chicago      | GMT-6
America/New_York     | GMT-5
America/Santiago     | GMT-4
America/Buenos_Aires | GMT-3
America/Sao_Paulo    | GMT-3
Europe/Lisbon        | GMT
Europe/London        | GMT
Europe/Berlin        | GMT+1
Europe/Athens        | GMT+2
Asia/Tel_Aviv        | GMT+2
Africa/Johannesburg  | GMT+2
Asia/Istanbul        | GMT+3

Asia/Taipei	         | GMT+8
Asia/Singapore       | GMT+8
Asia/Tokyo           | GMT+9
Asia/Seoul           | GMT+9
Australia/Sydney     | GMT+10


### File-Related Generators

* **FileGenerator**: generates java.io.File objects representing files in a given directory structure

* **FileNameGenerator**: generates file names representing files in a given directory structure.  
  It has a 'pathType' property which can be configured to generate `absolute`, `canonical` or `local` file names.

* **TextFileContentGenerator**: provides text file contents as String

* **BinaryFileContentGenerator**: provides binary file contents as byte[]

### State Generators

* **StateGenerator**: Generates states based on a state machine

* **StateTransitionGenerator**: Like the StateGenerator, but generating Transition objects

### Seed Based Generators

* **SeedWordGenerator**: Generates new words based on rules derived from a dictionary.

* **SeedSentenceGenerator**: Generates sentences based on rules derived from a text file.

## Distributions

A Distribution describes stochastic properties for distributing the data that Benerator generates. You can use the
predefined distributions or implement and introduce custom implementations. The most important types of distribution
are _Sequence_, _WeightFunction_ and _
CumulativeDistributionFunction_.

A Distribution implements a common concept for generating numbers or taking values from a data source and providing them
in a rearranged order or distribution with similar semantics as the number generation feature.

As an example, a 'Skip2' sequence might generate numbers with an increment of 2: 1, 3, 5, 7,… When it is used to
redistribute given data item1, item2, item3, item4,... , it would provide the values item1, item3, ...

While most Distribution components implement number generation as well data rearrangement, they are not required to
support both concepts.

All Distributions listed below are included in the default imports.

### Memory consumption

Distributions that are based on number generation may adopt data redistribution by simply loading all available data
into a long list in RAM and then using their number generation feature to determine indices of the data to provide. If
the data amount is large, you may get memory problems. In order to provide an easy start, Benerator reduces the default
size of these lists to 100,000 elements, prints out an error message if the number is exceeded, but simply continues to
work with the reduced amount of data. You can allow Benerator to use a larger cache by adding a benerator.cacheSize to
your **BENERATOR_OPTS**, e.g.

`-Dbenerator.cacheSize=2000000`

If this makes you run into an OutOfMemoryError, check the 
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) section on how to allocate a larger Java heap in Benerator.

### Sequences

Sequences reflect the idea of a mathematical sequence. They primarily focus in number generation, but they can be
applied for data redistribution as well. Most sequences have a default instance which can be used by their literal,
e.g. `distribution="random"` uses the `random` literal for the distribution defined in the class RandomSequence.

#### RandomSequence

| Class | RandomSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Creates uniformly distributed random values |
| Default Instance | random |

#### CumulatedSequence

| Class | CumulatedSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Creates random values with a bell-shape probability distribution |
| Default Instance | cumulated |

#### StepSequence

| Class | StepSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Depending on the settings of property 'delta', it starts with the min or max value of the specified range. With each further invocation, the 'increment' value is added. If addition makes the current value exceed the specified number range, the Sequence becomes unavailable. So the numbers provided are unique. Example: increment = -2, range=1..7: 7, 5, 3, 1 |
| Default Instances | increment: Uses delta = 1 to create incremental values, e.g. 1, 2, 3,... |

| Property | Property Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| delta | The difference between the next value and the previous one | 1 |

#### RandomWalkSequence

| Class | RandomWalkSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Starting with an → **initial** value, a random value between → **minStep** and → **
maxStep** is added on each subsequent invocation |
| Default Instance | randomWalk |

| Property | Property Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| minStep | The maximum delta between the next and the previous value | -1 |
| maxStep | The maximum delta between the next and the previous value | 1 |
| initial | If no initial value was configured explicitly, number generation starts with the min, max or medium value of the specified range – depending on the settings of minStep and maxStep | null |

#### ShuffleSequence

| Class | ShuffleSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Can be used to iterate quickly through a large number range with avoiding duplicate values. It starts from an offset of 0 and iterates the number range with a fix increment. After the range is covered, it increases the offset by one and reiterates the range. When the offset reaches the same value as the increment, it is set back to 0 again. For an increment of 3 in a range 1..7, the generated numbers would be 1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 3, 6, 1, 4, ... |
| Default Instance | shuffle |

| Property | Property Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| increment | See the class description | 2 |

#### WedgeSequence

| Class | WedgeSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Starting with first the lowest, then the highest available number, this alternatively provides increasing small numbers and decreasing large numbers until they converge in the middle and the Sequence becomes unavailable. So this generation is unique. For a number range 1..7, the generated numbers would be: 1, 7, 2, 6, 3, 5, 4. |
| Default Instance | wedge |

#### BitReverseSequence

| Class | BitReverseSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Creates numbers by continually increasing an internal counter and providing its value in bit-reversed order. This stops when each available number has been generated once, thus providing unique number generation. This comes close to a unique random distribution. |
| Default Instance | bitreverse |

#### ExpandSequence

| Class | ExpandSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Distributes numbers or data of unlimited volume in a unique or non-unique manner, by starting with a limited lower range and continuously expanding data region as data is generated. This comes close to a unique random distribution and can be used to iterate over very huge amounts of data. |
| Default Instance | expand |

| Property | Property Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cacheSize | The maximum number of elements to keep in RAM at the same time | 100 |
| bucketSize | The size of 'buckets' over which to distribute the iterated data. The smaller the number, the more buckets are used and the more erratic the generated data looks. | 10 |
| duplicationQuota | The probability by which a data element will be reused in a later call | 0 |

#### HeadSequence

| Class | HeadSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | When applied to a data source or generator, only the first few elements are provided. The number of elements is defined by the **
size** property. |
| Default Instance | head |

| Property | Property Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| size | The size of the buffer | 1 |

#### LiteralSequence

| Class | LiteralSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Defines a number sequence using a comma-separated list literal. |
| Default Instance | – |

| Property | Property Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| spec | A comma-separated list with all values in the order in which they shall be provided ,e.g. '2,3,5,7,11' | – |

#### WeightedNumbers

| Class | WeightedNumbers |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Creates numbers based on a weighted-number literal , e.g. '1^70, 3^30' for generating 70% '1' values and 30% '3' values. This is a convenient and simple approach for controlling parent-child cardinalities in nested data generation. |
| Default Instance | – |

| Property | Property Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| spec | A weighted-number literal. It lists weighted values in a comma-separated list. Each weighted value is specified by the numeric value followed by a circumflex (^) and the weight value, for example '1^70,3^30' | – |

#### FibonacciSequence

| Class | FibonacciSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Generates numbers based on the Fibonacci Sequence |
| Default Instance | fibonacci |

#### PadovanSequence

| Class | PadovanSequence |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Generates numbers based on the Padovan Sequence |
| Default Instance | padovan |

### Weight Functions

Weight functions are another special case of Distributions. They are based on a function which is supposed to allow
continuous value generation, but since Benerator needs to perform a numerical integration for deriving random values, a
granularity must be applied. This way, the generated value set is quantized. Another drawback of the approach is that
fine-grained generation is memory-consuming and slow.

Thus, it is recommended to avoid weight functions if possible and choose a similar Sequence or
CumulativeDistributionFunction instead.

#### GaussianFunction

Implements the well-known Gaussian Function.

Full class name: `com.rapiddweller.benerator.distribution.function.GaussianFunction`

Parameters: `average [, deviation]`

Example:

```xml

<import class="com.rapiddweller.benerator.distribution.function.*"/>
        ...
<attribute name="price" type="big_decimal" min="0.1" max="99.90" granularity="0.1"
           distribution="new GaussianFunction(50,20)"/>
```

#### ExponentialFunction

The Exponential Function.

Full class name: `com.rapiddweller.benerator.distribution.function.ExponentialFunction`

Parameters: `[scale,] frequency`

Example:

```xml

<import class="com.rapiddweller.benerator.distribution.function.*"/>
        ...
<attribute name="category" type="string" values="A,B,C" distribution="new ExponentialFunction(0.5)"/>
```

#### DiscreteFunction

Discrete Function that specifies an explicit weight for each possible value

Full class name: `com.rapiddweller.benerator.distribution.function.DiscreteFunction`

Parameters: `weight1 [, weight2 [, weight3 ...]]`

Example:

```xml

<import class="com.rapiddweller.benerator.distribution.function.*"/>
        ...
<attribute name="rating" type="int" min="1" max="3" distribution="new DiscreteFunction(1, 2, 1)"/>
```

### CumulativeDistributionFunction

The CumulativeDistributionFunction is another special case of a Distribution, which allows for continuous value
generation as opposed to Sequence and WeightFunction.

### ExponentialDensityIntegral

Inverse of the integral of the probability density `f(x) = a e^{-ax} (x > 0)`, which resolves to 
`F^{-1}(x) = - log(1 - x) / a`.

## Converters

Benerator supports two different types of converter interfaces:

* [com.rapiddweller.common.Converter](https://github.com/rapiddweller/rd-lib-common/tree/development/src/main/java/com/rapiddweller/common/converter){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" .external }

* [java.text.Format](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/Format.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" .external }

### Converter Setup

Instantiation of converters follows the same principles as other objects handled by benerator. They can be instantiated
either as beans (see NoiseInducer example below) or inline. 

An inline instantiation of the Mask converter below:

```xml
<iterate count="5" source="db" consumer="ConsoleExporter">
    <attribute name="column" type="string" converter="Mask"/>
</iterate>
```

Configuration for inline usage of converters 
(cp. `new Mask{maskChar = '$' }`) to set converter properties 
with curly brackets notation looks like:

```xml
<iterate count="5" source="db" consumer="ConsoleExporter">
    <attribute name="column" type="string" converter="new Mask{maskChar='$'}"/>
</iterate>
```

### Default Converters

The following converter classes are imported by default:

* **ByteArrayToBase64Converter**: Converts byte arrays to strings which are base-64-encoded

* **ByteArray2StringConverter**: Converts byte arrays to strings

* **ToLowerCaseConverter**: Converts strings to lowercase

* **ToUpperCaseConverter**: Converts strings to uppercase

* **LiteralParser**: Parses strings as numbers, strings, dates and times

* **Mask**: Replaces each character of a string with an asterisk '*' or another configurable character (
  property : `maskChar`).

* **MiddleMask**: Replaces each character of a string with an asterisk '*' or another configurable character, leaving a
  configurable number of characters unmasked at the beginning and/or the end of the string.

* **Append**: Appends a configurable suffix.

* **CutLength**: Cuts the length of a string.

* **MD5Hash**, **SHA1Hash**, **SHA256Hash**: Convert any data to a hexadecimal hash code

* **MD5HashBase64**, **SHA1HashBase64**, **SHA256HashBase64**: Convert any data to a hash code in Base64 format

* **JavaHash**: Convert any data to a hexadecimal hash code. This implementation is faster than the hash converters
  above

* **MessageConverter**: Converts an object, wrapping it with a message string, using a java.text.MessageFormat

* **PropertyResourceBundleConverter**: Uses a Java PropertyResourceBundle to translate keywords to translations in a
  given Java Locale

* **ToStringConverter**: Converts arbitrary objects to strings

* **UniqueStringConverter**: Assures uniqueness for all processed Strings by appending unique numbers to recurring
  instances (attention: limited to a few 100.000 elements)

* **URLEncodeConverter**: Applies a URL encoding to strings

* **URLDecodeConverter**: decodes URL encoded strings

* **PrintfConverter**: formats objects using a pattern in printf format

* **RegexReplacer**: Uses a regular expression to replace parts of the processed strings

* **String2ByteArrayConverter**: Converts Strings to ByteArrays. Might be useful for writing JSON to raw data types (BLOB, BYTEA).

* **SubstringExtractor**: Extracts substrings from strings. It has the properties `from` and `to`. If `to`
  is not set, it extracts from `from` until the end. If `to` or `from` is negative, it denotes a backwards
  position count, making e.g. -1 the last character position. 

* **EscapingConverter**: Escapes strings in Java style, like `A\tB`

* **Number2CharConverter**: Converts a number to a character of the corresponding ASCII code

* **Char2StringConverter**: Converts a character to a string of length 1

* **EscapingConverter**: Escapes control codes in a string in C and Java style, e.g. with `\r`, `\n`, `\t`

* **Number2CharConverter**: Converts a number to a character with the corresponding ASCII code, e.g. `65` → `A`

The package **com.rapiddweller.text** provides the following converters:

* **DelocalizingConverter**: Converts strings with non-ASCII letters to ASCII strings, e.g. Müller → Mueller, Sœr → Soer

* **NameNormalizer**: Normalizes a string by trimming it, normalizing inner white space and formatting each word to
  start with an uppercase character and continue with lowercase characters

* **NormalizeSpaceConverter**: Trims a string and normalizes inner white space to one space character

* **ToHexConverter**: Renders characters, strings snd integral numbers in hexadecimal representation

In the package **com.rapiddweller.benerator.primitive.number** there are two converters that can be used to quantize
numerical values:

* **FloatingPointQuantizer**, **IntegralQuantizer, NumberQuantizer**: Quantize numbers to be a **min** value plus an
  integral multiple of a **
  granularity**

* **NoiseInducer**: Adds numerical noise to numbers. The noise characteristics can be configured with the
  properties `minNoise`, `maxNoise`,
  `noiseGranularity` and `noiseDistribution`. When setting the boolean property relative to true, noise is relative,
  where `maxCount=1` corresponds to 100% noise-to-signal ratio. If `relative=false`, the absolute value of the noise is
  added or subtracted. Example:

NoiseInducer example:

```xml

<bean id="inducer" class="com.rapiddweller.benerator.primitive.number.NoiseInducer">
    <property name="minNoise" value="-0.2"/>
    <property name="maxNoise" value="0.2"/>
    <property name="noiseGranularity" value="0.01"/>
    <property name="noiseDistribution" value="cumulated"/>
    <property name="relative" value="true"/>
</bean>

<generate count="5" consumer="ConsoleExporter">
<attribute name="x" type="int" constant="100" converter="inducer"/>
</generate>
```

produces the result:

```bash
entity[x=99]
entity[x=105]
entity[x=92]
entity[x=104]
entity[x=99]
```

!!! tip
    Find out more about built-in converters in the rapiddweller 
    [rd-lib-common repository](https://github.com/rapiddweller/rd-lib-common/tree/development/src/main/java/com/rapiddweller/common/converter){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" .external }

### Java Formats

Beware that the [java.text.Format](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/Format.html) 
classes are not thread-safe!

* **SimpleDateFormat**: Uses a pattern to format dates as strings

* **DecimalFormat**: Uses a pattern to format numbers as strings

## Validators

For the validators from the domains see **[Domains](domains.md)**.

### Common validators

* **CharacterRangeValidator**: Validates if a character is in a certain range

* **NotNullValidator**: Requires the validated data to be not null

* **StringLengthValidator**: Limits allowed strings to a minimum and/or maximum length

* **StringValidator**: Validates string by min length, max length and a charactor validator

* **UniqueValidator**: Requires data to be unique (attention: limited to some 100.000 elements)

* **UnluckyNumberValidator**: Checks if a String contains an 'unlucky' number like 13 in western cultures or 4 in
  east-asian cultures

* **DayOfWeekValidator**: Accepts only Dates of certain (configurable) weekdays

* **RegexValidator**: Validates if a string matches a regular expression

* **LuhnValidator**: Checks if a number string (e.g. credit card number) is Luhn-valid

### Tasks

| timestampPattern | The pattern to render timestamp values | "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSSSS" |
| timestampCapitalization | The capitalization to use when rendering a month name in a timestamp: 'upper', 'lower' or 'mixed' | mixed |
| decimalPattern | The pattern to render decimal values | System default |
| decimalSeparator | The decimal separator to use for decimal values | System default |
| integralPattern | The pattern to format integral number values | System default |

The line format is described as a comma-separated list of property names with format spec, e.g. name[20],age[3r]
,points[5.2r0]. The format spec consists of

* [] brackets

* the (required) column width

* an optional alignment flag l, r or c (for left, right, center), left by default

* an optional pad character, space by default

So a property configuration of name[20],age[3r],points[5.2r0] would resolve to three columns,

first, a name entry, padded to 20 columns using spaces (default), aligned to the left (default)

second, an age entry, padded to 3 columns using spaces (default), aligned to the right

third, a points column, padded to 5 columns using zeros, having two fraction digits, aligned to the right

and would be rendered like this:

```
Alice Hamilton 2310.05
Bob Durand 4601.23
Helmut Schmidt 10226.14
```
