- removed hexadecimal syntax for decimal number literals in BeneratorScript
- removed property 'db' from SequenceTableGenerator (replaced with property 'database')
- renamed Entity2BeanConverter to Entity2JavaConverter
- merged OfflineSequenceGenerator into DBSequenceGenerator with property 'cached'
- replaced Iterable and Iterator with DataSource and DataIterator
- Changed signature of generate() method in Generator interface
- Renamed SimpleConverter to UnsafeConverter and SimpleGenerator to UnsafeGenerator
- New convenience methods in GeneratorUtil
- New helper class GeneratingConverter

- Renamed all 'precision' properties to 'granularity'
- Removed 'name' property from Sequence
- Renamed @DescriptorBased to @Descriptor
- Removed totalDigits and fractionDigits features
- Moved Consumer interface to org.databene.benerator, moved general implementations to org.databene.consumer
- Replaced generic parameter in Consumer interface with ProductWrapper
- Moved StorageSystem interface to org.databene.benerator, moved implementations to org.databene.storage
- removed generic parameter from StorageSystem.queryEntityIds() and StorageSystem.query()
- Renamed platform 'flat' to 'fixedwidth' and classes 'FlatFile...' to 'FixedColumnWidth...'
- <import defaults="true" /> is not necessary any longer: defaults are imported automatically, 
  they are only left out when using <setup ... defaultImports="false"> in the root element
- Replaced global <property> with <setting>
- Deleted MappedWeightSampleGenerator
- Renamed IndividualWeightGenerator to IndividualWeightSampleGenerator
- Renamed DistributingSampleGeneratorProxy to IndexBasedSampleGeneratorProxy
- renamed 'source' property to 'database' in DBSequenceGenerator and DBSeqHiLoGenerator
- cleaned up generator hierarchies for arrays
- changed Statement interface
- removed multithreading support for <generate> and <iterate> - anyway it never worked satisfactory
- dropped variable support in XML Schema-based file generation
- DbUnitEntityExporter uses UTF-8 by default

- Added configurable generatorFactory and defaultsProvider properties to BeneratorContext
- new annotation @DecimalGranularity
- New Converter class NumberQuantizer
- Defined SimpleMethodParamsGenerator as abstract parent class for Generators that create method parameters as Object arrays.
- Defined AsStringGenerator for wrapping an arbitrary Generator and return String representations of products
- CompositeStringGenerator supports uniqueness
