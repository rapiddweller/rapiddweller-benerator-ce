Release Notes benerator 0.4.0
=============================

Summary
-------
benerator now incorporates mature and comfortable 
generation capabilities for relational data, providing convenient database configuration 
and primary key generation, script support in generators and all import file formats, 
as well as a staging concept. Especially the script feature is a great improvement in 
generating randomized data with multi-field constraints.
  
Furthermore, central concepts were extended for generation of hierarchical data, like dependent 
data in databases or nested data structures like XML. After having left behind all open source 
alternatives with release 0.3, benerator competes with all commercial generation products.

Changes
-------
- nullable database columns are generated as null by default
- Processor replaced with Consumer
- Consumers are closed when the setup file is processed completely, not after the first <create-entities>
- System replaced with StorageSystem
- Task uses the Context interface instead of TaskContext and has new method wantsToRun()
- renamed PhoneNumber properties
