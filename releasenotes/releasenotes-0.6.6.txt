release notes benerator 0.6.6
=============================


summary
-------
Improved performance and fixed bugs. A memstore utility provides database-like features for tracking intermediary data. 
Simplified the transcoding of data graphs. Many smaller improvements from feature requests of Benerator users, e.g. 
extended formatting features for CSV-/FlatFile-/ScriptedEntityExporter. PersonGenerator and AddressGenerator can now 
be applied to composite regions like 'europe'. A new dependy checker verifies consistency of deployments. New DB Sanity 
features are supported.
