Concept:
- FamilyGenerator generate FamilyContainer contain FamilyPerson extends Person Entity so it have all Person's fields. Family specific data: PersonID, FamilyID, FamilyRole, relations(FamilyPerson (related person), RelationStatus)
- FamilyContainer have utility methods to count number of a generation: grandparents-parents-children, and get list of these generations so that you can extract data base on count information.

- FamilyPerson Generator implement RelationGenerator with generateFromEntityAndRelation() method to create 1 FamilyPerson Entity from some constraint of a pre-defined FamilyPerson Entity.
- ConstraintRelation contain the related rule from same attribute of pre-defined FamilyPerson Entity (in family case, for example: same family name, roles and different age).
- Generation Flow (after generate, add to FamilyContainer): 
  + (parent1)
  + (parent2) from (parent1) + (peerRelationConstraint)
  + (children(biological/adopt/twin)) from (parent1) + (parent2) + (lowerRelationConstraint)
  + (grandparents) from (parent1) + (parent2) + (higherRelationConstraint)
Demo: please check familyGenerationTest1.ben.xml in test/resource folder:
```
src/test/resources/com/rapiddweller/domain/family/familyGeneratorTest1.ben.xml
```
Custom attribute up to now:
  + general: Locale, Dataset
  + first parent: FirstParentMinAgeYears(default=21, must be at least 21), FirstParentMaxAgeYears(default=60) (this is exactly as PersonGenerator, this case femaleQuota is set default)
  + peerRelation (between parents or grandparents - same rule): MinDiffAgeInPeerRelation(default=-2), MaxDiffAgeInPeerRelation(default=5), ParentFamilyNameEnable(default=true-parents have same familyName), DivorcedParentQuota(default=0.2-this set relation between parents is DIVORCED), DiverseParentQuota(default=1-this is not applicable, please check Limitation)
  + higherRelation (between parent and grandparent): MinDiffAgeInHigherRelation(default=20), MaxDiffAgeInPeerRelation(default=50)- if father role, grandparents has same family name as father, different for mother role.
  + lowerRelation (between parent and children): MinDiffAgeInLowerRation(default=-50), MaxDiffAgeInLowerRelation(default=-20), MaxBiologicalChildrenNumber(default=10), MaxChildrenAdoptedNumber(default=5), MaxChildrenTwinCase(default=2)
Limitation:
Only fixed structure of family can be generated: 2 parent (father-mother), 4 grandparent (grandfather-grandmother of father/mother), children with maximum children number set default to 10, adopted to 5.
Diverse Gender is not applied, FamilyPersonGenerator is base on logic of PersonGenerator, this type of gender is not supported in this model now (change DiverseParentQuota attribute can cause error).
In this implementation, I re-construct new BirthdayGenerator, set attribute and init(context) again each time generate (to custom age from constraint), I think this can potentially cause performance issue. This will need to be improved.
Some test for generate non-null FamilyContainer, FamilyPerson as link below. The logic for constraints between FamilyPerson and performance test is not conducted all. This will need to be improved.
